Please see [our NPM repository](https://www.npmjs.com/~yocto) for complete list of available tools (completed day after day).

This generator build an **Yoctopus** *(Yes ou tools is a name of this tools ;) )* stack based on NodeJs / AngularJs and our [yocto modules](https://www.npmjs.com/~yocto).

## Motivation

We build this generator to gain time between each project. It provide for us : 

- An already defined project strcuture
- Pre build Gruntfile.js
- Pre build templates for AngularJs
- An already set up NodeJs application based on [yocto-core-stack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yocto-core-stack) package

After that go to the new project base directory and run the generator :
